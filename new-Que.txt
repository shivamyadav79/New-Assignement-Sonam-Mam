Write a Java program. The program should allow users to deposit, withdraw, and check their balance. Implement basic exception handling to ensure the program handles potential errors gracefully.

Requirements:
Bank Account Class:

Implement a BankAccount class with the following functionalities:
deposit(double amount): Adds the specified amount to the account balance.
withdraw(double amount): Subtracts the specified amount from the account balance.
getBalance(): Returns the current balance.
Use instance variables to store the account balance.
Exception Handling:

Implement exception handling to handle the following scenarios:
Negative deposit amount: Print "Deposit amount cannot be negative.".
Negative withdrawal amount: Print "Withdrawal amount cannot be negative.".
Insufficient funds for withdrawal: Print "Insufficient funds." if the withdrawal amount exceeds the current balance.
User Interface:

Implement a simple user interface using the main method where users can interact with their bank account.
Prompt the user to choose an action (deposit, withdraw, check balance).
Handle user input gracefully to ensure the program does not crash due to invalid input.
